# Sample Python Code for Authorize.Net
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-python)

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Python integration with the [Authorize.Net Python SDK](https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python).  
The samples are organized just like our API, which you can also try out directly at our [API Reference Guide](http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference).


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained. You can analyze them to get an understanding of how a particular method works, or you can use the snippets as a starting point for your own project.

You can also run each sample directly from the command line.

## Running the Samples
Clone this repository.
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-python.git
```  
Install the Authorize.Net Python SDK  
```
    $ pip install authorizenet
```  
Run the individual samples e.g.   
```
    $ python PaymentTransactions/charge-credit-card.py 
```
