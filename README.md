# Sample Python Code for Authorize.Net
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-python.png?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-python)

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Python integration with the Authorize.Net Python SDK (https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python).  
The samples are organized just like our API, which you can also try out directly here: http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference


##Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

##Running the Samples
